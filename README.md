# React State & Props

#### Getting Started with the previous project

#### Notes
1. For state we need to initialize it on constructor
2. To access 'this' we need to call super() before it
3. state must be object or null
4. Two Component's state is not same. They are different.
5. State can only be null or object
6. Props should be passed on constructor & super
7. defaultProps should be assigned. But can be used without it as well.
8. Props Validation
9. Set State & binding
10. forceUpdate & dom manipulation
